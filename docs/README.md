# SystemMonitor Documentation

This directory consolidates user-facing guidance and reference material for SystemMonitor. Start with the documents below:

- [`user-guide.md`](user-guide.md) — Launching the app, understanding menu bar indicators, and working with the detail window.
- [`interface-guide.md`](interface-guide.md) — Annotated breakdown of the menu bar UI and detailed view layout.
- [`detail-page-guide.md`](detail-page-guide.md) — Step-by-step instructions for opening and troubleshooting the detailed resource window.

If you contribute new features, add or update companion documents here to keep the package release flow predictable (`package_app.sh` bundles this directory alongside the app`).
